# You can provide values in this file that will override the default values built into the astra-installer
# application. This is essentially the same concept as using a dotenv file, but the format is yaml.

# Config precedence (higher on the right): default values -> .config.yaml -> ENV variables

# All ENV variables should be prefixed with ACOP
# Keys in the .config.yaml file are not case-sensitive, but they are for ENV variables.

# You can set host=localhost in your development environment, this allows the server to
# start on the localhost instead of trying to open an external port, avoiding the annoying pop up
# on Mac development environment when the controller app is started.
host: "localhost"

# If McAffee takes the default 8082 port that is used by the operator override it for your dev env here
HealthProbePort: 8083
